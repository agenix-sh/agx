# Execution Layers

**This document has been moved to the central Agenix repository.**

## Canonical Location

See: [`agenix/docs/architecture/execution-layers.md`](../../agenix/docs/architecture/execution-layers.md)

This specification defines the five execution layers (Task, Plan, Job, Action, Workflow) that are fundamental to the entire AGEniX ecosystem. It is maintained in the central `agenix` repository to ensure consistency across all components (AGX, AGQ, AGW, and all AUs).

## Quick Reference

The five execution layers are:

1. **Task** - Atomic tool/AU call (executed by AGW)
2. **Plan** - Ordered list of Tasks (generated by AGX)
3. **Job** - Execution of a Plan (tracked by AGQ)
4. **Action** - Many Jobs in parallel (batch processing)
5. **Workflow** - Multi-step orchestration (future)

For the complete specification, please refer to the canonical document in the agenix repository.
