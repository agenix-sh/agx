# EXECUTION-LAYERS.md
### Canonical Nomenclature for AGX / AGQ / AGW Ecosystem

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Authoritative Vocabulary Specification  

This document defines the **five execution layers** of the AGX agentic ecosystem.

---

# 1. Task  
### *Atomic execution unit*

A **Task** is the smallest possible executable operation in the system.

### Characteristics
- Executes a single tool or AU  
- stdin → tool/AU → stdout  
- Deterministic  
- Executed by **AGW**

---

# 2. Plan  
### *Ordered list of Tasks*

A **Plan** is a deterministic, linear structure describing what to do, step-by-step.

### Characteristics
- Generated by **AGX**  
- JSON  
- Linear (Phase 1)  
- Executed by AGW  

---

# 3. Job  
### *Execution of a Plan by one AGW*

A **Job** is the concrete runtime instance of a Plan.

### Characteristics
- Stored & tracked by **AGQ**  
- Pulled & executed by a single AGW  
- Has status, timestamps, logs, retries  

---

# 4. Action  
### *Embarrassingly-parallel execution of many Jobs*

An **Action** groups many Jobs that apply the same Plan to different inputs.

### Characteristics
- Fan-out parallelism  
- Batch processing  
- High throughput  

---

# 5. Workflow *(Future)*  
### *Chained Actions / conditional logic*

A **Workflow** orchestrates multiple Actions or Plans.

# Summary Table

| Layer | Name | Description | Created By | Executed By |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Task** | Atomic tool/AU call | AGX | AGW |
| 2 | **Plan** | Ordered Tasks | AGX | AGW |
| 3 | **Job** | Execution of a Plan | AGQ | AGW |
| 4 | **Action** | Many Jobs in parallel | User/AGX | Many AGWs |
| 5 | **Workflow** | Multi-step orchestration | AGX | AGQ/AGW |

# Mapping to Codebases

### `agx`
- Generates Plans  
- Defines Actions  
- Future: workflows  

### `agq`
- Stores Plans  
- Manages Jobs  
- Schedules Actions  

### `agw`
- Executes Tasks  
- Runs Jobs  

### `agx-* tools`
- Implement Tasks  
- Register capabilities
